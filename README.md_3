## Architecture Principles
- **Manifest-First Design**: Integration begins with static declaration
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complexity emerges only when needed
- **Observability Over Orchestration**: System state is fully observable, minimally controlled
- **Failure as First-Class Citizen**: Every integration path handles failure gracefully

## Error Handling
All components implement:
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Graceful degradation
- Comprehensive error logging
- Fallback strategies for critical failures

# Autonomous Cross-Domain Integration Framework (ACDIF)

## Overview
ACDIF enables emergent intelligence through structured autonomy by enforcing a single constraint: **Every module communicates exclusively through typed, versioned capability manifests**. This framework creates a seamless integration layer for AI ecosystems, allowing autonomous research and deployment without human intervention.

## Core Components

1. **Capability Manifest System** (`manifest.py`)
   - Machine-verifiable, human-readable manifests using Pydantic validation
   - Semantic versioning with strict compatibility rules
   - Capability taxonomy with input/output schemas

2. **Decentralized Registry** (`registry.py`)
   - Firebase Firestore backend for global coordination
   - Real-time manifest publishing and discovery
   - Version control with automatic conflict detection

3. **Integration Engine** (`engine.py`)
   - Progressive disclosure of complexity
   - Capability matching and adaptation pipelines
   - Observability-first design with comprehensive logging

4. **Conflict Resolution** (`conflict_resolver.py`)
   - Multi-strategy conflict resolution (merge, override, compose)
   - Priority-based decision making
   - Automated fallback mechanisms

5. **Adaptive Resolver** (`resolver.py`)
   - Machine learning-powered capability matching
   - Similarity scoring with confidence thresholds
   - Automatic adaptation path generation
